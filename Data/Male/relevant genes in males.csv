ADAM15 serves to curtail TRIF-dependent TLR3 and TLR4 signaling and, in doing so, protects the host from excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. In conclusion, to our knowledge, our study clearly shows for the first time that ADAM15 plays an unexpected role in TLR signaling, acting as an anti-inflammatory molecule through impairment of TRIF-mediated TLR signaling. The nockdown or knockout of ADAM15 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 15), a host protein involved in neuroblastoma diseases, leads to Tick-borne encephalitis virus replication and assembly defects.;"Ahmed S, Maratha A, Butt AQ, Shevlin E, Miggin SM.
